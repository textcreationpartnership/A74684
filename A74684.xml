            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus God hath graciouſly pleaſed to make them inſtruments of his Mercy, but to keep within their ſphere, or in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of mundane affairs; the mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, with the Peers of this Britiſh Iſland, by cuſtome condeſcended to have been made free of ſome Trade, Company, or ſociety of their Subjects, in the Metropolitan of <hi>England:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170325:6"/> the <hi>Lucitanian</hi> Kings, with their Nobility, have not onely accepted the title of <hi>Merchant,</hi> but have really imployed adventures at Sea, to encourage their ſubjects in advancing their publick good, and ſtrengthening themſelves both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>States by Traffique have riſen out of a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, dilating their juriſdictions equall to the potent Princes of the Earth; and to deſcend unto particulars, how many great and eminent Families in all Countreys have been raiſed out of the dirt, or from deſpicable degrees, and yet elevated to the moſt illuſtrious Titles that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects could be capable of, or Princes could confer on them, ſitting at the helm of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks? others again with ſhip-wrackt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, emerg'd in their eſtates, through their own extravagant courſes (not ſteered within compaſſe) the injuſtice of others, or the injuries of Fortune; yet it hath often pleaſed God to allot this means whereby they have been buoy'd up again, and proſperous gales have filled their ſails, untill they have anchor'd in the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Pen, Sword and Merchandizing, have been generally in all ages the inſtrumentall means of accumulating worldly bleſsings, and preferring men to eminency in Honours, and
<pb facs="tcp:170325:7"/> temporall poſſeſsions; as for thoſe who riſe by the expoſition of politicall or municipal Laws, I do not deny but it is of it ſelf an honourable imployment, eſpecially to all candid breaſts, in whom Juſtice keeps her Courts of Judicatory, her Scales not uſed to weigh their gold, but the cauſe; where bribed Rhetorick is not allowed to gild over an unjuſt Proceſs, to make the richeſt cauſe (though the fouleſt) ſeem fair, to procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate with Demurs, or Fines and Recoveries without end or recovery; when as the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is but about <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum;</hi> and the generall reaſon wherefore, the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and civil diſſentions; yet caſes may be doubtfull, though often viſibly unjuſt. Thoſe <hi>Ovid</hi> ſeems to check.</p>

            <p>Secondly, for the Sword, grave <hi>Cicero</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the unjuſteſt Peace before the juſteſt War; beſides, it raiſes but a few by the ſuppreſsion of many, and the common Souldier, or generall part, are but the back ſtairs for others to climb
<pb facs="tcp:170325:7"/> up by to eminency, and all the others have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to glory in, but how Princes and States are indebted to them; or in their badges of grinning Honour, which they bare before them as Cognizanſes of their valour, ingrav'd in their bodies with capitall Characters by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Steel, where one may read (as in an Hiſtory at large) the ſtorming of Forts, razing of Towns, or affronting the Canon, diſgorging Death's Commiſsions, wrapt up in Fire and Smoke; ſome with half faces, or diſmembred bodies, repaired with wooden limbs, like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Statues, that have ſtood century many years in the open air, untill defac'd by the hand of Time.</p>
            <p>O wretched ſtate or Principality, where crooked juſtice muſt be rectified in iron bodies, her ſcales thrown away, and appeales made to the Sword as Umpire, licenſed by inciſions to cure Wounds, contentions to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, injuries to ſupport Right, Injuſtice Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and tumults Peace! Theſe are dire pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments from above, phlebotomiſing distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Common-wealths, or politick Bodies falling into a Phrenſie: as in humane actions we often ſee, deſperate Diſeaſes have deſperate Cures, and by Medicines or Corroſives, many times more violent for the preſent
<pb facs="tcp:170325:8"/> then the malignancy of the Malady, fearing a relapſe, or a totall ſubverſion; whereas the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Merchant is beneficiall to all, in Barter or currant Coyn, and by his happy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall inricheth himſelf and thoſe he trades withall, exchanging his Cargazones, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing his Treaſure for the accommodation of others. Thus raiſeth many, ruines few, a free Trade, by compulſion nothing, onely dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying others. <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I have toucht at the three chief Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, tending to Riches and Honor, as the ſole ſcope aimed at by worldly men, one of them no friend to Peace, nor neceſſary at all times, of Neceſsity rarely; litigious men are the Lawyers Stewards; and which of theſe three Vocations ought to be preferred in a glorious Common-wealth, moſt candid Reader, judge, I will not be one of the Inqueſt to give my verdict, becauſe moſt will cenſure according to their educations, or as their naturall diſpoſitions incline them, which renders man partiall, by being prone to what he loves or follows: yet that I may not be cenſur'd for what is paſt, I will thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an account of my ſelf. Before the uncivil <hi>Scots</hi> commenc'd a civil War, I had ſerv'd both by Sea and Land in a juſt defenſive quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, which the Law of God and Nature does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb facs="tcp:170325:8"/> the Maritine Employment pleaſed me beſt, by reaſon my former ſtudies had initiated me in the grounds of Mathematicall Sciences, whereby Navigation ſeem'd facile and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as for the Common Law, I never lov'd contention, nor put on the Gown, but onely have obſerved the practice of men, and found all theſe courſes good and laudable, if not abuſed by ſiniſter ends, and the lawfull endeavours of every man (in honeſt vocations) highly to be commended: ſo I will make no farther a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs herein, but retreat to my ſubject and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended courſe.</p>
            <p>Many will ſtart Objections (as Huntſmen Hares) and purſue them over others unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table grounds, which incited me to make my former books of Arithmetick better for uſe, and more perſpicuous to the underſtanding by this Treatiſe, once before attending the Preſs, and now you, with the regulation of Commerce and Trade, accommodated to all ingenious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; preſcribed rules being equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to all; for thoſe who know not how to buy, will be ignorant how to ſell, or how to borrow, that know not how to lend. Beſides theſe, here are divers Geometricall Propoſitions appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Manufactury Trades, and ſome for the Surveyer, Souldier, Engineer, and Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,

                           <p>But this Segment (according to common practiſe) is meaſur'd in the middle) by taking the Arithmeticall mean, that is by adding the ſides of the two ſquares together, and taking the half of that for the common ſquare, as in this, 1 and 3 makes 4, the half 2, whoſe ſquare 4 multiplied into the length, 15, the product will be 60 feet, for the content, according to cuſtome, which is apparently erroneous, and 5 feet too little in this piece, as before was demonſtrated; divers other errours (in meaſuring of ſolid bodies) are crept in for want of Art, and having got poſſeſſion of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, they plead preſcription and cuſtome

                           <p>
                              <hi>Divide the number of Inches contained in a Cubicall Foot,</hi> viz. 1728, <hi>by the ſquare inches of any common Baſis given, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhewes what length muſt be required in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that body to be equal unto a Cubicall Foot.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>All Timber to be meaſured by this common Ruler, is ſuppoſed to have four equall and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel ſides, or reduced unto it by girting the tree with a ſmall line, and taking ¼ part or that for a common ſquare. This done, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler divided into inches, and every inch into eight or tenne equall parts, begin firſt with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der meaſure, as one inch ſquare will require 1728 in length, that is 144 feet, to make one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170325:90"/> cubicall foot; 2 inches hath 4 for the ſquare with which divide 1728, the quotient will be 432 inches, or 36 feet in length to make one foot; 3 inches ſquare will require 16 feet in length; 4 inches 9 feet, 5 inches ſquar'd is 25, with which divide 1728, the quotient will be 69 3/25 inches, that is 5 feet 9 3/25 inches for the length, at 6 inches the ſide of the ſquare, that is 36, will have 4 feet in length: 7 inches muſt have 2 feet 11 13/49 inches in length to make one foot, at 8 inches ſquare 2 feet 3 inches in length will be equall to one cubicall foot. Thus you may finde the under meaſure to each quarter of an inch, with Decimall fractions, if you pleaſe, as at 8 ¼ inches, by my former rules of fractions, the ſquare will be 1089/16 with which divide 17280, the quotient will be 2 feet 1 inche and 4/10 or ⅖ very neare: and a tree 8 ½ inches ſquare will require in length to make a foot 23 9/10 inches almoſt. Now having paſt the under meaſure, you may proceed in the ſame manner to 36 inches, or more if you pleaſe, but it is unneceſſary, the encreaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little, as halfe inches not well to be diſtinguiſhed; ſo in caſe a tree ſhall prove above three feet for the ſide of the ſquare, I have preſcribed rules in number how to meaſure it, or by the Ruler thus, Take half the ſquare and ſo meaſure the tree according to the length, the quantity ſo found will be ¼ of the whole content, as in the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, page 109 of my <hi>Naturall Arthme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
                              <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170325:90"/> Thus having found all the parts from an inch unto 36 or 40 inches, you may make a table of them, or inſcribe them on a Ruler, as you think good.</p>
